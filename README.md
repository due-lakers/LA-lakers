# LA-lakers

The educational data set which we used is collected from learning management system (LMS) called Kalboard 360. Kalboard 360 is a multi-agent LMS, which has been designed to facilitate learning through the use of leading-edge technology. Such system provides users with a synchronous access to educational resources from any device with Internet connection.

This project contains two sub-projects: 

- machine learning and back-end part (python) and 
- user interaction and visualization part (javascript)
