                <h5>Dataset Information:</h5>
                <p>
                  This is an educational data set which is collected from
                  learning management system (LMS) called Kalboard 360. Kalboard
                  360 is a multi-agent LMS, which has been designed to
                  facilitate learning through the use of leading-edge
                  technology. Such system provides users with a synchronous
                  access to educational resources from any device with Internet
                  connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The data is collected using a learner activity tracker tool,
                  which called experience API (xAPI). The xAPI is a component of
                  the training and learning architecture (TLA) that enables to
                  monitor learning progress and learnerâ€™s actions like reading
                  an article or watching a training video. The experience API
                  helps the learning activity providers to determine the
                  learner, activity and objects that describe a learning
                  experience.
                </p>
